Estonian village between the mountains has become empty, almost everyone has returned to their homeland, only 2 men have stayed: Ivo and Margus. But Margus will leave as soon as he has harvested his crops of tangerines. In a bloody conflict in their miniature village wounded men are left behind, and Ivo is forced to take them in. But they are from opposite sides of the war. This is touching anti-war story about Estonians who find themselves in the middle of someone else's war. How do they handle it? How do the enemies act under third-party roof?\nWritten by\nAnnts	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwNzA3MDQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MDE5NDE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi2747316761/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1564427991577.mp4?Expires=1619437972&Signature=Avkl~mCMWwD8bwD2LveVOrYh4M6uSWhsH-T0wbwKP3W1P~N6OQ6btuazYm8JC0r2f0Fe1Q~U9cI~LN1wmEDsZ2ET4r6Ntrte7WjrSQfiCUqnYRPBIx4Xwzl3K7rw-zKFz-7jHW5lg80gbo8xnBQbbGrQsR2Ew-q-dvVtoBwwqusPn7NI8SpeZIpWkpb1ZNo4Xak5Uccsv4x-u98p0clSpmaxUrLHsS8PdsQMlqpJF5PCBpq-NUdR5DnEwSxc2HWezoIZnwLbCBLQ6PQKePtAKVm~Nl8LYX15d6kHOHQNDVZSEAg6nXFhS6I6bvQaQB0QaH9UwG195cBR3o1yySlfwA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	17 October 2013 (Georgia)			8.2 based on 42,110 user ratings	1h 27min	Estonian\n|\nRussian\n|\nGeorgian	Allfilm, Georgian Film

13	tt1375666	/title/tt1375666	Inception	Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.\nWritten by\nWarner Bros.

32	tt0056058	/title/tt0056058	Seppuku	Peace in 17th-century Japan causes the Shogunate's breakup of warrior clans, throwing thousands of samurai out of work and into poverty. An honorable end to such fate under the samurai code is ritual suicide, or hara-kiri (self-inflicted disembowelment). An elder warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act. There, he learns of the fate of his son-in-law, a young samurai who sought work at the house but was instead barbarically forced to commit traditional hara-kiri in an excruciating manner with a dull bamboo blade. In flashbacks the samurai tells the tragic story of his son-in-law, and how he was forced to sell his real sword to support his sick wife and child. Tsugumo thus sets in motion a tense showdown of revenge against the house.\nWritten by\nKevin Rayburn <kprayb01@homer.louisville.edu>	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjBmYTQ1NjItZWU5MS00YjI0LTg2OTYtYmFkN2JkMmNiNWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg			16 September 1962 (Japan)			8.6 based on 44,365 user ratings	2h 13min	Japanese	Shochiku

The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge.\nWritten by\nChris "Morphy" Terry	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDliMmNhNDEtODUyOS00MjNlLTgxODEtN2U3NzIxMGVkZTA1L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi2628367897/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1473794595177.mp4?Expires=1619435535&Signature=Z3Wh--UEMcBSgHweLOwWfTTosxqxAlRUZbEn7E3tn6OPus3madW7TLhvalQC1b4fg0VxmJBlKk4bpHY7B8ybMqxqC60LWV8ELfp-yRjcADkcPqAev20nLXt9~olCk0WUNMcw7RIzfgkLT3GjD6W4oI~EFnYdfETnxwmn23JkdtB0T1ZZ34Ay0ptbknFJnTfUZODNlAbvS9O1g0w0V9oUlLJnN8GfihGQ5nO9JKgqPugrdAnZv98BP2zmg4cYNluF5Cd8LUf0VO2rE4bpOwBEWi5uobbfnHkkpKiMCMsE3sarSr5R8p7uYvjSbk4Kkf3bZ~9OQuZEI0d0oLCrDPhpnQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	3 June 2000 (Armenia)			8.5 based on 1,360,170 user ratings	2h 35min	English	Dreamworks Pictures, Universal Pictures, Scott Free Productions

Told in a flashback, Salvatore reminiscences about his childhood and his relationship with Alfredo, a projectionist at Cinema Paradiso. Under the fatherly influence of Alfredo, Salvatore fell in love with film making, with the duo spending many hours discussing about films and Alfredo painstakingly teaching Salvatore the skills that became a stepping stone for the young boy into the world of film making.

55	tt0032553	/title/tt0032553	The Great Dictator	20 years after the end of WWI, in which the nation of Tomainia was on the losing side, Adenoid Hynkel has risen to power as the ruthless dictator of the country. He believes in a pure Aryan state and the decimation of the Jews. This situation is unknown to a simple Jewish Tomainian barber who has been hospitalized since a WWI battle. Upon his release the barber, who had been suffering from memory loss about the war, is shown the new persecuted life of the Jews by many living in the Jewish ghetto, including a washerwoman named Hannah with whom he begins a relationship.

The film begins in 1984 when Wiesler attends a play written by Georg Dreyman, who is considered by many to be the ultimate example of the loyal citizen. Wiesler has a gut feeling that Dreyman can't be as ideal as he seems, and believes surveillance is called for. The Minister of Culture agrees but only later does Wiesler learn that the Minister sees Dreyman as a rival and lusts after his partner Christa-Maria. The more time he spends listening in on them, the more he comes to care about them. The once rigid Stasi officer begins to intervene in their lives, in a positive way, protecting them whenever possible. Eventually, Wiesler's activities catch up to him and while there is no proof of wrongdoing, he finds himself in menial jobs - until the unbelievable happens.\nWritten by\ngarykmcd	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThkM2EzYmMtNDE3NS00NjlhLTg4YzktYTdhNzgyOWY3ZDYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQzNzQxNzI@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg			23 March 2006 (Germany)			8.4 based on 363,907 user ratings	2h 17min	German	Wiedemann & Berg Filmproduktion, Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), ARTE

Not knowing what to expect, while on a mission to shed light on his opaque past, grizzled Noodles reunites with his only living friend, Fat Moe, after thirty-five haunted years of self-exile.

As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history.\nWritten by\nThe Massie Twins	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJiNDEzOWYtMTVjOC00ZjlmLWE0NGMtZmE1OWVmZDQ2OWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi3738173977/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1616202372085.mp4?Expires=1619436057&Signature=oO55z8-pUR17YnS0M4rOVN4EqbKKw5iPK5suSp5SwUq~zrOHO3IXCjWzVACj8lEr7SlOtY3gUTXOiFEsp8tSZ3cf-kDc9VVc76ZRrGm-zs6toPVapkiGgelkh~~wWTMijd4MY1Q3qn8omKkHtBz1xjhI03A4Sq9Oc2obh3ZJFYsff3E3ssJGWTGx7LJX1Zj5nMIRrthahyCBvJQv~ax~ajfLapKZQNEBi64X6ZR-DM16WSBCK~sPWpTQP8IUmhx9Wysptj4I96Yf-hbHvS0FceHLBlUi9BL1jzsSTHDeziQiX8rlbXwv4XQstwY-aNfcvnMjTDdJEg0rugObuUynQQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	20 August 2009 (Germany)			8.3 based on 1,290,725 user ratings	2h 33min	English\n|\nGerman\n|\nFrench\n|\nItalian	Universal Pictures, The Weinstein Company, A Band Apart

And Ishaan just cannot seem to get anything right in class. When he gets into far more trouble than his parents can handle, he is packed off to a boarding school to 'be disciplined'. Things are no different at his new school, and Ishaan has to contend with the added trauma of separation from his family. One day a new art teacher bursts onto the scene, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, who infects the students with joy and optimism. He breaks all the rules of 'how things are done' by asking them to think, dream and imagine, and all the children respond with enthusiasm, all except Ishaan. Nikumbh soon realizes that Ishaan is very unhappy, and he sets out to discover why. With time, patience and care, he ultimately helps Ishaan find himself.	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDhjZWViN2MtNzgxOS00NmI4LThiZDQtZDI3MzM4MDE4NTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi1834943001/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1563657987957.mp4?Expires=1619436083&Signature=gSmL4QrTFIB9cw8M6UkmTne1QBHBtDP2eX4b0rs2wfCYcARw8Y6CPLcsp5lRQaTfWRFZLu-TC8WRnjyidlOVdaCR0KTqMOPzvBkrrNCd2ewX~hkqxMmZxk8sEWsy9bZqF91KZNKCswF6LFCR0KoBlifiax-pRRWNgbp52Nrzz6cjh0QV7rUoY53W0W-uZ1iOltoAGG6mZeJnH2A9G17yapIsX5H8TTDA57~kL7bC~vW0gzgVSMFaq2NrvzufgwwITN8V0YsQSVPrqJxA1TcwL8iH~H9qwshUKq1mG0qxZWCBS712D~0Np3d1pqiGLlG7Pw2kPooPiVF-ktqaPL6S-Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	21 December 2007 (India)			8.4 based on 172,864 user ratings	2h 45min	Hindi	Aamir Khan Productions, PVR Pictures

Sometime in the distant past, someone or something nudged evolution by placing a monolith on Earth (presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well). Evolution then enabled humankind to reach the moon's surface, where yet another monolith is found, one that signals the monolith placers that humankind has evolved that far. Now a race begins between computers (HAL) and human (Bowman) to reach the monolith placers. The winner will achieve the next step in evolution, whatever that may be.\nWritten by\nLarry Cousins	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmNlYzRiNDctZWNhMi00MzI4LThkZTctMTUzMmZkMmFmNThmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi2674767897/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1524260381054.mp4?Expires=1619436103&Signature=r2URNYhDKztgYmqwf80F9Yrv0YizorwhiO2v6mjfRuHfUSBFhKm~QtWQchSDPE0o0LRyfyOU-8c9SRzuDnRX9FEHSptJLF4hvrPLhICvNSRPDJhUim69wReQnsAAfPxGpLmDQpyQvXLbBSjgu7z1Qx6FnBZbVb-NP43mD0vQMM~RmxjqPgRfZDTGY9DOtLmMLj8D4rL56hsbWnaposdoZIRAmRjxiowYy1N~LKR~7IVpepIKYxBUWhX6MnVHfipF6NTweJJxR0j-u3A5iqWwyHq09~S-KlRTjXWEsXhtCTiJZuwVEM2DBiqS3oiUleYg2if1NS-z0rko2PIrGuGLGg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	12 May 1968 (UK)			8.3 based on 611,960 user ratings	2h 29min	English\n|\nRussian	Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Stanley Kubrick Productions

282	tt1070874	/title/tt1070874	The Trial of the Chicago 7	In Chicago 1968, the Democratic Party Convention was met with protests from activists like the moderate Students for a Democratic Society led by Tom Hayden and the militant Yippies led by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, which led to violent confrontations with the local authorities. As a result, seven of the accused ringleaders are arraigned on charges like Conspiracy by the hostile Nixon administration, including Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers who was not involved in the incident. What follows is an unfair trial presided by the belligerent Judge Hoffman (No relation) and prosecuted by a reluctant but duty-bound Richard Schultz. As their pro bono lawyers face such odds, Hayden and his fellows are frustrated by the Yippies' outrageous antics undermining their defense in defiance of the system even while Seale is denied a chance to defend himself his way. Along the way, the Chicago 7 clash in their political philosophies even as they learn they need each other in this fight.\nWritten by\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol1970@gmail.com)	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYzOGE1MjUtODgyMy00ZDAxLTljYTgtNzk0Njg2YWQwMTZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi3081552153/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1600872710739.mp4?Expires=1619438756&Signature=c20x0JGuZwygpKdsa~ejArtP-Q5TFKXTDH8vXHVp5lzMg9MREa1wYkpnJfHsg072ArgJXfJGCaeQ-3JIFHR1NqOFKGD5CCdelVADW6EOSopW8W20ehNt-IXDm3-BAuGy9lSHvLIwJ4FxVZUP9YOJ4ZwnZ~06RC1NyZ1aeJpeIZSweGGadcooCdyonDPN89oUDSy-vaaccMvM39F1NFqwUqT3lRBCXF4v2uSQqFOucCNkPYNFSKKjMuSwTBvWMJB1P4mTe~WCM9eQB7HKiJKZZ3ut7OdehlCbqP7-ODpUi9rFiZlYuhOgSu1ubTnS20xVj8CIG76yERqzxsUaD~9d-Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	16 October 2020 (USA)			7.8 based on 134,412 user ratings	2h 9min	English\n|\nLatin\n|\nFrench	Dreamworks Pictures, Amblin Partners, Aperture Media Partners

We know it well; after the first glass of wine, the conversation lifts, the possibilities open up. Martin is a high school teacher. He feels old and tired. His students and their parents want him terminated to increase their average. Encouraged by the per mille theory, Martin and his three colleagues throw themselves into an experiment to maintain a constant alcohol impact in everyday life. If Churchill won World War II in a dense fog of spirits, what could the strong drops do for them and their students? The result is positive in the beginning. Martin's class is in a different way now, and the project is being promoted to a real academic study with the collection of results. Slowly, but surely, the alcohol makes the four friends and their surroundings loosen up. The results are rising, and they really begin...\nWritten by\nKenneth Kjær	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTNjM2Y2ZjgtMDc5NS00MDQ1LTgyNGYtYzYwMTAyNWQwYTMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjE4NzUxNDA@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi4070162713/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1601473324272.mp4?Expires=1619438814&Signature=KPU6MwpA~Jfgn8zAXrrkZ54xQoYlo-HzkWvhtKRmi0IjsafTUhLqLSfWM7IYXhM9NBbtUhTE3~5cFgJS4~~u4o~bSJs5c7UXpVkUexgZpVCj3akXFZHQkYOa-eB23jhojwHKt6~aOV54i~TcYrzUymOUsLme9RrX1~FM78G5FI4k9vm5ve4jEz~Rb7XHl2xm3EtCkmRQ7ETNKIAy4vnygCxTuu4lRx9IWeVm8QLJMHe8upwFkWCCkeSwPRQCfhVbaF0dhSHOf5WK8l~xM14zcAJFES7rGO0Jfo08VasWNK87UZgFKC8UvEWMIG8aJhtSRyJl8muITWC0R0QyVcx-5A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	24 September 2020 (Denmark)			7.8 based on 62,788 user ratings	1h 57min	Danish\n|\nSwedish	Zentropa Entertainments, Film i Väst, Zentropa International Sweden

Lonnegan demands satisfaction for the insult. After his partner, Luther, is killed, Hooker flees, and seeks the help of Henry Gondorff, one of Luther's contacts, who is a master of the long con. Hooker wants to use Gondorff's expertise to take Lonnegan for an enormous sum of money to even the score, since he admits he "doesn't know enough about killing to kill him." They devise a complicated scheme and amass a talented group of other con artists who want their share of the reparations. The stakes are high in this game, and our heroes must not only deal with Lonnegan's murderous tendencies, but also other side players who want a piece of the action. To win, Hooker and Gondorff will need all their skills...and a fair amount of confidence.\nWritten by\nheadlessannie	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU3NjQ4YTMtZGJjOS00YTQ3LThmNmItMTI5MDE2ODI3NzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTY1NTc@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi2717122841/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1563832025441.mp4?Expires=1619436372&Signature=r42D1YUIqF8IlCrlJQGxijcNCsPTa6MytWPqdyP24ruXjpljZwq1FtMGraVqeThQB9U3QQXRDNHbLmmFQ7~oRJ4SL7XCdQSxjiFkfiEbPFAbKyitvKv9PogiI3QMiZBy6mWpaDaeFQzcj9OXrOx0wiJsmop22S-r-dMjd9ByzxsUlgIto0hWvqqxLEtX6j-~HV7Soq~0fCDxZUNEKgcwmeVrVbH3TfRBj2QPh4I1CBrufnPohpMSDM9YjfaBCVhpyI60x08cTYf9RBjibNft7d-K0oABuCLFYnKNNWKj~uLxRHgyTWK2HLfpCNWtVcgfJ6pQfifRR3psdEV6TCt3Wg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	25 December 1973 (USA)			8.3 based on 244,442 user ratings	2h 9min	English	Zanuck/Brown Productions, Universal Pictures

It's been eighteen short months since the deadly confrontation in Per un pugno di dollari (1964), and this time, the solitary stranger, now a professional bounty hunter, will have to go against his beliefs and do the unthinkable: join forces with the hawk-eyed marksman, Colonel Douglas Mortimer, to collect the hefty reward. Now, as El Indio and his cut-throats have already set their sights on robbing the crammed-with-cash Bank of El Paso, the stage is set for a bloody showdown at high noon, against the backdrop of silent double-crosses and fragile allegiances. But, is it worth dicing with death for a few dollars more?\nWritten by\nNick Riganas	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWM1NmYyM2ItMTFhNy00NDU0LThlYWUtYjQyYTJmOTY0ZmM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi773831705/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1562946166609.mp4?Expires=1619436435&Signature=glgGyt1GFs8oLfr9PJ8oPPGHreHviwgpRGhL4EFJGt0wjqIZYYHaRzjSdlgfqidksGkyJFh72eNSHP7rWlOFZQYvNejsvDCTw6zP7WhxdEmJCeRB5tm5x3CEjx5-Gc57iujcJ6UpjcRu3Vxp3~9JLOrv7gt9xRSpHkSdPtxYtsJq9GxNCs274BiJ0TT~ToPNXWmYrw51WaE3P70bIk9FVim1aZHlhFZ8GB2~xoYrdbJEaT4go1GnovfNXYb2y1JIbS7-nX77dPHzWObvri29KKV059m9WZemYqaOhPBw5CbWzu5kN0NoBeBZ5Q3IOwkjWdA9dkFy6VB70OfbsM9n9A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	20 December 1965 (Greece)			8.2 based on 236,009 user ratings	2h 12min	Italian\n|\nEnglish	Produzioni Europee Associate (PEA), Arturo González Producciones Cinematográficas, Constantin Film

In Berlin, capital of the Third Reich, Adolf Hitler proclaims that Germany will still achieve victory and orders his Generals and advisers to fight to the last man. "Downfall" explores these final days of the Reich, where senior German leaders (such as Himmler and Goring) began defecting from their beloved Fuhrer, in an effort to save their own lives, while still others (Joseph Goebbels) pledge to die with Hitler. Hitler, himself, degenerates into a paranoid shell of a man, full of optimism one moment and suicidal depression the next. When the end finally does comes, and Hitler lies dead by his own hand, what is left of his military must find a way to end the killing that is the Battle of Berlin, and lay down their arms in surrender.\nWritten by\nAnthony Hughes {husnock31@hotmail.com}	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0NTU5NTAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzYwMDg2._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg			16 September 2004 (Germany)			8.2 based on 335,060 user ratings	2h 36min	German\n|\nRussian\n|\nFrench\n|\nEnglish	Constantin Film, Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)

That case is the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto. In addition to seeing the extreme grief of the victim's husband Ricardo Morales, Benjamín, his assistant Pablo Sandoval, and newly hired department chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings were personally affected by the case as Benjamín and Pablo tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him. Despite the department already having two other suspects, Benjamín and Pablo ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gómez is the real killer. Although he is aware that historical accuracy is not paramount for the novel, the process of revisiting the case is more an issue of closure for him.

In actuality, the creature on display is indeed a man, twenty-one-year-old Joseph "John" Merrick, who has several physical deformities, including an oversized and disfigured skull, and an oversized and disfigured right shoulder. Brutish Bytes, his "owner", only wants whatever he can get economically by presenting Merrick as a freak. Treves manages to bring Merrick under his care at the hospital, not without several of its own obstacles, including being questioned by those in authority since Merrick cannot be cured. Treves initially believes Bytes' assertion that mute Merrick is an imbecile, but ultimately learns that Merrick can speak and is a well-read and articulate man. As news of Merrick hits the London newspapers, he becomes a celebrated curiosity amongst London's upper class, including with Mrs. Kendal, a famed actress. ...\nWritten by\nHuggo	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDVjNjIwOGItNDE3Ny00OThjLWE0NzQtZTU3YjMzZTZjMzhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi1763229209/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1593421147127.mp4?Expires=1619436928&Signature=f0ya7Qs9na9sQbm55CxQ0QMDkB9yw4y~D9MLvOsZKA2tSvCFvxslxBkRH-yQ1kVU7-jiZbTHAEDo1XZESGfOlaDJRLg59nXOdWl~Ngfj3I062f-1tvoBarL7tvoODMZqHCaZUDj5sh3ph5kI5hAUShNoNkuAlKxiuDtpUt2pVrb1uKZY6~hB0LADLO6tN9-6I35aZaOESOYXnjPIHWi7aYusXeHYg5M4jrCs9ctAgGryKYe24omD3GIHNdp-0JHgJZEGohaNAvEZiJKkvfkfB-rtnrui7BAsUnKpbqpaCsVQaXZnyGErXmTBtzxLRuqI6ZsX633FfXy52WQp774OwQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	10 October 1980 (USA)			8.1 based on 223,282 user ratings	2h 4min	English\n|\nFrench	Brooksfilms

As a result, Truman's picturesque neighbourhood with the manicured lawns and the uncannily perfect residents is nothing but an elaborate state-of-the-art set, and the only truth he knows is what the worldwide television network and its deep financial interests dictate.

Like any good mother, Ma dedicates herself to keeping Jack happy and safe, nurturing him with warmth and love and doing typical things like playing games and telling stories. Their life, however, is anything but typical--they are trapped--confined to a 10-by-10-foot space that Ma has euphemistically named Room. Ma has created a whole universe for Jack within Room, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that, even in this treacherous environment, Jack is able to live a complete and fulfilling life. But as Jack's curiosity about their situation grows, and Ma's resilience reaches its breaking point, they enact a risky plan to escape, ultimately bringing them face-to-face with what may turn out to be the scariest thing yet: the real world.\nWritten by\nA24	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NzgzNzEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMzMDE0NjE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi321566745/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1563959760170.mp4?Expires=1619437199&Signature=lJTVaJE12k2PY3lraXtmenWlhigoswzcDD~jSxT4xUWtCR5zYP5s3NQxgu8TdJa0ZgBKeHFrVTXFNXXGcI3qa2jgsWT3cSy0n7cI-jKeaY5VWPO2gqQm-4cHEsAiIIlgRbwhY1lPu67SgYEHoJppgNgo0vdevQz9ukK-01NeqUYsUyNvtjUMrRKsFKBSuvM-r-Mt07-hJ90kClNoFl9BKqAnGSso22N3P9EM8DTM6xC1GWHurFSjR46qovi6TEj4gepP6etBJufhr~MCsT~sGM6YvbASV8oi5gNoTCYs0mz1rcbqvIHhjbOAj6PpEaEy3YDxgPyYagka-7a6Gyxr6g__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	15 January 2016 (Ireland)			8.1 based on 379,342 user ratings	1h 58min	English	Element Pictures, Film 4, FilmNation Entertainment

Dressed to kill, at night, Cassie frequents the local bars and nightclubs, pretending to be dead-drunk, utterly helpless and vulnerable. And, every week, lethally beautiful Cassie is on the prowl for all sorts of nocturnal predators and other wolves in sheep's clothing, who are unaware that, sometimes, the hunter can become the prey.

However, new beginnings are always challenging, and to find out what is best for the family, let alone start a 50-acre farm to grow and sell Korean fruits and vegetables, is easier said than done.

The movie takes us from the tortured remains of one victim to the next as the sociopathic "John Doe" (Kevin Spacey) sermonizes to Detectives Somerset and Mills -- one sin at a time. The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and subdued tones characteristic of film noir. The seasoned and cultured but jaded Somerset researches the Seven Deadly Sins in an effort to understand the killer's modus operandi while the bright but green and impulsive Detective Mills (Pitt) scoffs at his efforts to get inside the mind of a killer...\nWritten by\nMark Fleetwood <mfleetwo@mail.coin.missouri.edu>	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUwODM5MTctZjczMi00OTk4LTg3NWUtNmVhMTAzNTNjYjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi2508831257/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1540843135385.mp4?Expires=1619435287&Signature=P7GiuDOcAmAZCroFa5CQcEcqdG-n2aYkIYBVUzkNj2jkhJL4zVaJH7YBa9Kb~v2J5EGf1nmkDbgf5raCh8eO0B59pynLOvAxb1JBzuLDL1ts5ufiPvhNW1ZaAdD-WbXmY4i8~MjMWTBG6rMA-GEVtXobkICn46nYAoRiU~QIVHMibgsXwAr38gwjLz2ZqC1QajFAB6P1x-~lLcYn0vfL7anEJ4inzv2d2Y22aGd8rrcP5JCyhpPMnJlnrKOMihFpftYPh0QO4VIESEBSY1sDxCSPAjes9jrh2t5lEq6qmlG5wOVyy4kMvS3KIjy42guT1wOXp~-LBAET7LVw6ammNw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	22 September 1995 (USA)			8.6 based on 1,469,563 user ratings	2h 7min	English	Cecchi Gori Pictures, Juno Pix, New Line Cinema

This goal is despite not coming from a pedigree of greatest, musical or otherwise, with Jim, his high school teacher father, being a failed writer. Andrew is starting his first year at Shaffer Conservatory of Music, the best music school in the United States. At Shaffer, being the best means being accepted to study under Terence Fletcher and being asked to play in his studio band, which represents the school at jazz competitions. Based on their less than positive first meeting, Andrew is surprised that Fletcher asks him to join the band, albeit in the alternate drummer position which he is more than happy to do initially.

84	tt0086879	/title/tt0086879	Amadeus	Antonio Salieri believes that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music is divine and miraculous. He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing. He began his career as a devout man who believes his success and talent as a composer are God's rewards for his piety. He's also content as the respected, financially well-off, court composer of Austrian Emperor Joseph II. But he's shocked to learn that Mozart is such a vulgar creature, and can't understand why God favored Mozart to be his instrument. Salieri's envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart. He is ready to take revenge against God and Mozart for his own musical mediocrity.\nWritten by\nKhaled Salem	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJlNzUzNGMtYTAwMS00ZjI2LWFmNWQtODcxNWUxODA5YmU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi2535496985/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1564471972600.mp4?Expires=1619436045&Signature=f3azg2h3D9YVT3aQkKPrDuDDn9WGu7wtrCGgUHC3o5gevE8v9NGpWbfK--EF2WD~wO-s2vkGCg8ojUncWDIPtW~ZQdd~WgkGUbd9nYDQR7pFDxcnktP5myTPI6fJo~E7wvDZWdAxDzW0TucKfhSHL022cVXO8pXFwB7zKYeeI8Ddo-CU0cYRjwlXKkg1lZogIbhgtQH-aJ6vHJauWI6P7eZxT7K3bnOQc4j9PGseW01JDJb~U-no-z8f9EPLsFadMwC7dcNTi4Co66qFKG1hPNByhJunJ5yjiUNc0Xv3qIpP8LPA8FyOgdoKycZdxXzMtjTyGPL30BUeCN1ddpY1iQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	19 September 1984 (USA)			8.3 based on 373,583 user ratings	2h 40min	English\n|\nItalian\n|\nLatin\n|\nGerman	AMLF, The Saul Zaentz Company

Both perpetuate the public perception if only to please their adoring fans and bring people into the movie theaters. In reality, Don barely tolerates her, while Lina, despite thinking Don beneath her, simplemindedly believes what she sees on screen in order to bolster her own stardom and sense of self-importance. R.F. Simpson, Monumental's head, dismisses what he thinks is a flash in the pan: talking pictures. It isn't until The Jazz Singer (1927) becomes a bona fide hit which results in all the movie theaters installing sound equipment that R.F. knows Monumental, most specifically in the form of Don and Lina, have to jump on the talking picture bandwagon, despite no one at the studio knowing anything about the technology.

Dobisch, Kirkeby, Vanderhoff and Eichelberger - on a rotating basis for their extramarital liaisons in return for a good word to the personnel director, Jeff D. Sheldrake. When Baxter is called into Sheldrake's office for the first time, he learns that it isn't just to be promoted as he expects, but also to add married Sheldrake to the list to who he will lend his apartment.

The most promising offer turns out to be the driver for the African-American classical pianist Don Shirley for a concert tour into the Deep South states. Although hardly enthused at working for a black man, Tony accepts the job and they begin their trek armed with The Negro Motorist Green Book, a travel guide for safe travel through America's racial segregation. Together, the snobbishly erudite pianist and the crudely practical bouncer can barely get along with their clashing attitudes to life and ideals. However, as the disparate pair witness and endure America's appalling injustices on the road, they find a newfound respect for each other's talents and start to face them together. In doing so, they would nurture a friendship and understanding that would change both their lives.\nWritten by\nKenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzIzYmJlYTYtNGNiYy00N2EwLTk4ZjItMGYyZTJiOTVkM2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY1NDk1NjE@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi824752921/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1534255695298.mp4?Expires=1619436520&Signature=AIQOxu2QH-3D8f5wICasqZIMJPuHbXeWirCO8EXQZmxH~Fb78RUCoVPpio-VaKVN7fZXYq1KCcr-qSMqnX8uloXSNFjp6yWJQSPrNyJRvPxs-FX8JMxe91BWRiaC4LVVlB9crsodv3wdD-2yNGntizmWJd36PuU-fVnJPhgjER5Zyjy93ov392G6t5QxSsrnYRg-VQUbTxsQFtqKEbUyPCK78NueVKswRMFqIuaslZGX4xwsMbie4dU7gK~i02NkP7kR9bWHtJJ-ijmmHKPkOKdYdz4z8CmAh9yy2RQ-etTj6mefiTCFiFcLEhVHS-BSBJjoItDS04EA-lJpaQMe-Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	16 November 2018 (USA)			8.2 based on 398,377 user ratings	2h 10min	English\n|\nItalian\n|\nRussian\n|\nGerman	Participant, Dreamworks Pictures, Innisfree Pictures

Miner turn oilman Daniel Plainview is a driven man who will do whatever it takes to achieve his goals. He works hard but he also takes advantage of those around him at their expense if need be. His business partner is his son H.W., who in reality he "acquired" when H.W.'s biological single father, who worked on one of Daniel's rigs, got killed in a workplace accident.

His current target is Hollis Mulwray, high-profile chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, whose wife suspects him of infidelity.

They are trying to kill a dog that has escaped from their base. After the destruction of the Norwegian chopper the members of the US team fly to the Norwegian base, only to discover them all dead or missing. They do find the remains of a strange creature the Norwegians burned. The Americans take it to their base and deduce that it is an alien life form. After a while it is apparent that the alien can take over and assimilate into other life forms, including humans, and can spread like a virus. This means that anyone at the base could be inhabited by The Thing, and tensions escalate.\nWritten by\ngrantss	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGViZWZmM2EtNGYzZi00ZDAyLTk3ODMtNzIyZTBjN2Y1NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi2298151193/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1564011064429.mp4?Expires=1619436913&Signature=qWaVmwdFmS5uJkQnizGzt1zytUn7BW1NAWJTlnh5wZgZaYkaIoBDdEfDhdmxvOuXDXg~pbs89y2T1-tDi1wIw2mqiyWknlR-2szN2YZ0SSvHF1JLeeushMtgWW5I7g01gBoeZH8FB4a10Rtasp-vwI84FsI6vdqBqsfgmtE0O-LfIraI8ZeZsH249bdy-HwLeqtqlu9wtTQ2zRib8acD-etkrYSRJV8Lyx6~y4VnzYgHEx12AaF5l5OIObvcwwHgpLDyz7t4aivFD~oOX5qMVAxIpRRQe3MqNliGdoIOpucMONBUwm~ksPZFDPEkgqeQUIjsDJhi1XnO6p~RzC2Luw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	25 June 1982 (USA)			8.1 based on 376,713 user ratings	1h 49min	English\n|\nNorwegian	Universal Pictures, Turman-Foster Company

Now, with a newfound means to gain the respect he deserves, Vinz vows to kill a cop if his friend Abdel dies in the hospital, due the beating he received while in police custody.\nWritten by\nb4arr2y	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDNiOTA5YjktY2Q0Ni00ODgzLWE5MWItNGExOWRlYjY2MjBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi1231338009/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1549983204504.mp4?Expires=1619437684&Signature=YvPMsEMoON3j6WezcJmn5y63l8igS9mSnBNM18RWLw7WXaOIR1Ufs8epdtHV3D3~VOiE5vOrrmBuNx2vwVQMzvSorTZ6wt29b~1M6W-dN4mBxdTJpXds0X9sJMtfgJwA02J4k4f4xQlF1v-~mIUmNNHanAo5HmCvrzR0pZdvwhHOVNOtw~GvK8O2JRz3iZ7l7CjvYueKywHvHb8PmVGESHPMTKw2b6RqVagR8YGbdTEp6-BX-2ezFDgrSJh~OxYdwIcerEaX08fFCSPxjZZHEEqm~qYY2ZdDPXL0m5GVbPi7j5za5Cb09~777tynp2neQKVTkMWZev7Joq3RAMgdsg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	31 May 1995 (France)			8.1 based on 153,831 user ratings	1h 38min	French	Canal+, Cofinergie 6, Egg Pictures

She's the President of her sorority, a Hawaiian Tropic girl, Miss June in her campus calendar, and, above all, a natural blonde. She dates the cutest fraternity boy on campus and wants nothing more than to be Mrs. Warner Huntington III. But, there's just one thing stopping Warner (Matthew Davis) from popping the question: Elle is too blonde. Growing up across the street from Aaron Spelling might mean something in Los Angeles, California, but nothing to Warner's East-Coast blue blood family.

A nobody. When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon's McMafia)-and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.\nWritten by\nUniversal Pictures	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5YTRlZmUtZGVmYi00ZjE2LWIyNzAtOWVhMDk1MDdkYzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMxOTE0ODA@._V1_FMjpg_UX1000_.jpg		https://imdb-video.media-imdb.com/vi1348059417/1434659607842-pgv4ql-1612738777562.mp4?Expires=1619441797&Signature=rdVH2s6aLBywW9mLO9lCIa0W~o0uolRFQLbQt2j~icMXRQkg~pToLlML9xpgP0KG7FCWaxqdCchH-lcwg-LbCIFY5vmamP7vWVNRB4mt7ue797nyh3aT56KEwOeYllO5o7HBXmGDqh7JgnzjYVgogM~DdqNQ2RXKL4xP8W2kZrITJ7mukIGJI8cj52VGkpthwJZf1DLB2gg7Kd09wPYoL-ufCTnAkuCmXV~QupoFAeDVwSDxF6snQC~SjSggZVUAILcP84n97BFUieP0logbgsQWR2-PclOeC0D96kzGTe3agQGTKNLKYyH6kizetJpsQ9ODX~8~eS10bJ2KavridQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIFLZBVQZ24NQH3KA	26 March 2021 (USA)			7.5 based on 45,380 user ratings	1h 32min	Spanish\n|\nRussian\n|\nEnglish	87North, Dentsu, Eighty Two Films
